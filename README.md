# 🤖 ThinkBot: AI Research Paper Analyst with Citation and Hypothesis Generator

**ThinkBot** is an AI-powered research assistant built using **IBM Watsonx Prompt Lab**. It helps researchers analyze academic papers by automatically generating structured summaries, identifying research domains, proposing hypotheses, and extracting citation-worthy insights to accelerate academic productivity.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Researchers face challenges in understanding and summarizing large volumes of scientific literature. Manually extracting key information is time-consuming and error-prone. ThinkBot solves this by automating research analysis using IBM Watsonx's powerful large language models (LLMs).

---

## ⚙️ System Workflow


->The ThinkBot workflow begins with users uploading or pasting research text (abstract or full paper). 
->This input is embedded into a structured prompt within IBM Watsonx Prompt Lab. 
->The model processes the prompt and generates an organized output including summaries, hypotheses, citations, tools, and limitations. 
->The response is displayed within Watsonx Prompt Lab or via an optional UI, providing quick and accurate insights into research content.
